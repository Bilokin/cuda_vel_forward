## cuda_vel_forward

- cuda speed up for waveform-inversion-vel-to-seis and some findings
- (500, 1, 70, 70) --> (500, 5, 1000, 70): about 1min on RTX 5090

## usage
```shell
python setup.py install
```

```python
from cuda_vel_forward import Vel_Forward
...
# B, 1, 70, 70
lbl = torch.from_numpy(lbl).float()
a = Vel_Forward()

# B, 5, 1000,70
gen_arr = a(lbl).cpu().numpy()
```

## notes
MAE is highly correlated with the reconstruction error, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76 on the validation set. This insight can guide trainingâ€”for instance, by jointly training a Reward Model alongside the main network.
